# My Awesome Project

Welcome to My Awesome Project! 
This project, I built a three-page website to demonstrate my HTML skills. I used HTML tags to organize the content in a clear and easy-to-follow way. To make the website user-friendly, I added tables to display data, forms for user input, and dropdown menus for easy navigation. I designed the website's layout for ease of use. By using HTML tags, I made the website accessible to everyone. I also used tables to present complex data simply.. Additionally, I added forms to allow users to interact with the website and dropdown menus to make navigation easy. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in web development and improved my skills in HTML, layout design, and user interface creation.
